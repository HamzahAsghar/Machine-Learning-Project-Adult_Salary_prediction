This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually based on the "Census Income" dataset. Several classification algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated.

Key Features
1. Algorithms:
   Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression
2. Best Model:
   Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting income levels.
3. Tools:
   Python, Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion
Random Forest emerged as the top-performing model with an accuracy of 85%. Decision Tree also performed well, while Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting showed lower accuracy.
